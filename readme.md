## 🛠 Prerequisite for spotify downloads: **Export Your Spotify Data**

Before using Potty, you need to request your personal Spotify data from Spotify’s Privacy page. Spotify will provide you with a ZIP file containing several JSON files, including one named YourLibrary.json.

This YourLibrary.json file contains your saved tracks, albums, and playlists metadata, which Potty can use to generate the track list and manage downloads.

How to get your Spotify data:

    Go to Spotify’s Privacy Request page.

    Request your personal data export.

    Spotify will email you a ZIP file when ready.

    Extract the ZIP and locate YourLibrary.json.

    Use or convert this JSON file as the basis for your data/tracks.json to run Potty.

This step is essential to generate the input data Potty needs for downloading your favorite music.
